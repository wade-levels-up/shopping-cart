# Shopping-Cart

Technologies used:

React, Vite, Styled-Components, React-Router, Vitest, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Overview:

For this project I was given the task of creating a shopping-cart web application.
Users are able to browse items online, add items to cart, remove items from cart, increase and decrease item quantites. The checkout button will not function as it is beyond the scope of this project's requirements.

Objective:

The objective of this project was to put to use my learnings around testing in React, single-page application and routing, fetching data (and handling errors) and styling React applications.

Conclusion:

Using the Styled-Components library for CSS-in-JS was great! It was nice to be able to style components within their own local scope and not leave the Component.jsx files to go searching for their corresponding CSS files.

React Router came in handy for handling different URL's, though I didn't have to create too many different routes. A key part of React Router was creating child routes that filled the main part of the website whilst leaving the header and footer in place.

Testing is something I'd like to learn more about, specifically integration testing rather than unit testing. I created some components and testing to check that they rendered. I'd like to continue this project by creating some integration tests and use mocks. It was challenging to know what to test, as when I was building the page I was mostly testing the UI components by interacting with the development page in the browser.
